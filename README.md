How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

There is a lot as a programmer that you have to account for while writing code. Writing tests and manually reviewing code is essential to ensure that the code runs. However, you are reliant that the code for the tests is functional. Well-written code is absolutely critical for code security also, but just like your tests, you are reliant on the software you are implementing to perform its intended function as well. You must have confidence in your abilities and the software you are using.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Learning to write code isn't easy, though it is a skill like any other. Inter-personal skills are no different. They can be taught and learned just like C++ or Java. Often times focus is put on the importance of coding knowledge, and while it is absolutely essential that one knows how to code in order to write code, interpreting a client's needs can be the difference between a successful project and a failed or abandoned project. Learning communication skills will improve a programmer's success at any level of their programming ability.

How do I approach designing software?

I have learned there are numerous ways to approach software design. You can take an Object-Oriented Approach, or a testing approach, or a client-driven approach. The thing is, they vary so wildly you almost cannot even compare one approach to another. The goal for all of them is the same, creating functional software. I don't want to get caught in being tied to one approach. I want to try and stay as flexible as possible as I am only starting my journey into software development and I do not know in what industry I might land. My goal is to learn as many different approaches as possible. While I may prefer some over others, I know, simply being exposed to new approaches will help make me a more well-rounded programmer.
